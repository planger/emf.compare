	 * {@link DifferenceKind.ADD} instead of {@link DifferenceKind.REMOVE} must be merged first.</li>
	 * <li>Equivalent differences regarding two "eOpposite" sides, with both sides being a single-valued
	 * reference (one-to-one). In such a case, we need to merge the difference that results in setting a
	 * feature value over the difference unsetting a feature. This is needed to prevent information loss.</li>
	 * <li>Equivalent differences with conflicts: basically, if one of the diffs of an equivalence relation is
	 * in conflict while the others are not, then none of the equivalent differences can be automatically
	 * merged. We need to consider the conflict to be taking precedence over the others to make sure that the
	 * conflict is resolved before even trying to merge anything.</li>
	 * <li>Equivalent {@link ReferenceChange} and {@link FeatureMapChange} differences: in this case the
	 * {@link FeatureMapChange} difference will take precedence over the {@link ReferenceChange} when the the
	 * resulting operation actively modifies a FeatureMap. The {@link ReferenceChange} will take precedence
	 * when a FeatureMap is only modified implicitly. This happens in order to prevent special cases in which
	 * the {@link ReferenceChangeMerger} cannot ensure the correct order of the feature map attribute.</li>
