/**
 * Three-way differencing utility for plain text.
 * <p>
 * Taking three versions of a plain text as input (the origin, left, and right version), a three-way diff
 * provides the information on whether the left and right version underwent conflicting changes and, if not,
 * enables to compute a new merged version of the text so that all changes of the left and right version are
 * combined.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The differencing, conflict detection, and merging is line-based; that is, a conflict-free merge can only be
 * performed if each single line is changed only on one side (left or right), each changed line on one side
 * has not been deleted on the other side, and a total order of lines can be found (e.g., no additions of new
 * lines at the same line). Otherwise, the modifications of the left version and the right version are in
 * conflict.
 * </p>
