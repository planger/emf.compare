ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.disableResolvers = Disable model resolution
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.disableThreading = Disable multi-threading during model resolution
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope = Resolution scope:
ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.description = The model resolvers will try and find cross referenced resources starting from the compared one in order to determine the logical model that needs to be compared along with it. This can be used to widen or reduce the scope in which EMF Compare will seek these linked resources.

ModelResolutionPreferencesPage.resolutionScope.invalid = Invalid resolution scope value.

_UI_NoProblems_message = There are no problems with the computation of the comparison
_UI_DefaultProblem_message = Problems encountered. Click on each problem for further information. The computed comparison and the merge you will do on it may be inaccurate. We suggest you to fix the errors before doing any merge or to switch to text comparison (use 'Text Compare' below)
_UI_Cancel_message = Operation has been canceled. The computed comparison and the merge you will do on it may be inaccurate. We suggest you to be very careful or to switch to text comparison (use 'Text Compare' below)
