This test just checks the existence of the Logical Model View, and the initial state of its toolbar buttons.

1. Select Window/Show View/Other...
2. Click on EMF Compare/Logical Model View item
3. Click on a model in Project1
// Assert that the view is not populated (because the synchronization is not active)
4. Activate the synchronization
// Assert that the view is populated with the logical models computing from the selected model(because the synchronization is active)
5. Change resolution scope in preferences from container to workspace
// Assert  that the view has been refreshed and new elements appeared.
